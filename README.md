# TechLingo.fyi

TechLingo.fyi is a free and open-source project aimed at making it easy for newcomers to understand all the buzzword and other code-related terms that we, as programmers tend to use with so much familiarity.

## Tech behind

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with some help from Vercel's v0 and a lot of help from ChatGPT, so do not expect a wonderful codebase.

## Search

The search is provided by Algolia, and it is necessary to index every time a new lingo gets added to the site, to reindex manually, run:

```shell
node utils/algoliaIndexing.js
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
